JavaScript Introduction
Welcome to the world of JavaScript! This versatile programming language is widely used for web development, and it runs in browsers, servers, and even on IoT devices. Letâ€™s dive into some key concepts:

Js Variable with Descriptive Name Convention
When declaring variables, follow these conventions:

var: The oldest keyword for variable declaration in JavaScript. It has global scope and is function-scoped. However, itâ€™s considered outdated and is rarely used in modern code.
const: Use const for variables that wonâ€™t change after initialization. It has block scope and is not reassignable.
let: Use let for variables that need to be reassigned. It also has block scope.
Remember, JavaScript is a dynamic language, and its syntax draws inspiration from Java and C. Many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. Happy coding! ðŸš€

# JavaScript Data Types, Operators, and Conditionals
## _Data Types_

JavaScript supports several primitive data types:

**Numbers**: Represent both integers and floating-point numbers.
**Strings**: Enclosed in single or double quotes.
**Booleans**: Represent true or false values.
**Undefined**: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
**Null**: Represents an intentional absence of any value.
# _Operators_

**Logical Operators**
Logical operators play a crucial role in decision-making within code:

## _AND (&&) Operator:_
Combines two or more conditions.
Returns true only if all conditions are true.

## _OR (||) Operator:_
Returns true if at least one condition is true.

## _NOT (!) Operator:_
Returns the opposite of the operandâ€™s truthiness.

## _Conditional (Ternary) Operator:_
The conditional operator (? :) is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands:
A condition followed by a question mark (?).
An expression to execute if the condition is truthy, followed by a colon (:).
An expression to execute if the condition is falsy.

## _Truthy and Falsy Statements_
To evaluate whether something is truthy or falsy, consider the simplest possible Boolean logic statement.

Remember, JavaScript is a dynamic language with syntax inspired by Java and C. These concepts are fundamental for creating nuanced and context-specific logic in your JavaScript programs. Happy coding! ðŸš€
